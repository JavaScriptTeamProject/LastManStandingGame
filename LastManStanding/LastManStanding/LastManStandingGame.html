                <p>There once was a very lonely wizard. He knew his chances of finding his half were not so good, so he decided to boost them up, by going to a parallel universe in the future, where men are significantly fewer. A bit after his arrival he saw that this was a huge mistake, because a group of space amazons are abducting all men, leaving him in a difficult and dangerous situtation, between women in strong need of male company.</p>
